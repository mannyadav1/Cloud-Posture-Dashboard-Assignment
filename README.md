The Problem: Chaos in Cloud Security
Security teams waste hours daily because existing tools show everything to everyone.
Aman (Security Lead) drowns in 500+ alerts, Srishti (Engineer) gets vague "Fix S3 bucket" tickets without context, and Rohit (Incident Responder)juggles browser tabs during breaches. Same data, wrong presentation for each person's job.

Our Solution: One Dashboard, Three Smart Views
One tool that adapts to show exactly what each person needs:

Aman's View: Top 10 critical risks only (cuts triage from 2h→15min)
Srishti's View: His team's issues + ready-to-run commands (fix success: 40%→85%)
Rohti's View: Attack path map + "Isolate Now" buttons (investigation time: -70%)

Key Features
✅ Smart Filtering - Each role sees only relevant risks
✅ Action-Oriented - Every screen has "do something" buttons
✅ Emergency Ready - Special mode for breach containment
✅ Engineer-Friendly - CLI commands, not vague tickets
✅ Leadership Reports - Automated compliance PDFs in 1 hour (not 3 days)


I have also made the 3 wireframes Dashborad.png  , Remediation Console.png and  Incident Response console.png from the figma to show the UI and architecture approach of my solution to this problem 
I have also attached the User Personas of 3 different users in the industry 
I have also explained the detailed features, prioritization, and success metrics
